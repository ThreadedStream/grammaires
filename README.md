# grammaires

This repository has no specific meaning or goal whatsoever. Maybe, beginning of its existence has something to do with the fact that just recently I've started
reading "Flex And Bison" book written by John Levine, or maybe I simply got really sad out of the fact of not having any repo related to grammars of formal languages. Anyways, innate tendency of changing my mind so often will eventually lead me to deciding on what meaning does this repo actuall possess, in case if I do not abandon the work too soon. Well, good luck to me.
